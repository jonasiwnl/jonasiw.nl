		<h1 class="pb-3 text-2xl underline">about</h1>
		<p>I like building things and learning about how systems are designed. I'm studying computer science at the <a href="https://umich.edu/" target="_blank">University of Michigan</a> and currently taking courses on distributed systems and computer architecture.</p>
		<br />
		<p>I'll be joining <a href="https://glean.com" target="_blank">Glean</a> this summer. Previously, I worked at <a href="https://www.vectra.ai" target="_blank">Vectra AI</a>, a cybersecurity unicorn, and <a href="https://www.courierhealth.com/" target="_blank">Courier Health</a>, a Series A healthcare startup.</p>
		</p>

            Outside of engineering I like to hike, explore new places, invest, and write. I also play soccer and chess occasionally.
